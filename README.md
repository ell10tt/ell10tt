# 👋 Hey, I’m Vlad

🎓 Front-End Developer Student  
🧩 I build interfaces, then take them apart to understand why they work.

I study frontend development and focus on clarity:  
clear layout, clear logic, clear interaction.  
I like when code is readable a month later and interfaces don’t need explanations.

⚡ **Side note**  
I trust simple solutions. If something looks complex, I try to make it quieter.
